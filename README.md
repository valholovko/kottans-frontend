Lesson 1: Git and GitHub

I had some experience working with GitHub before, but that knowledge was so superficial that I could only perform pull and push requests, check the status of the repository, move the changes to the staging index and perform some basic stuff :) 
After completing this course I understand how this all functions under the hood, how to properly work with branches, perform merges and maintain nice and clean commit history.
